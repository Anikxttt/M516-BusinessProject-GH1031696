# Personalized Recommender System â€“ Online Retail II Dataset

This project implements a personalized recommender system using the Online Retail II dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The system is built to suggest relevant products to customers based on their past purchase behavior, using collaborative filtering and other recommendation techniques.
